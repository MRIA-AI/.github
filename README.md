# MRIA


Doctors and Nurses say this;  

"We spend more time with computers and reports than seeing our patients, Asking a lot of questions to our patient, can actually change a lot, but we too doctors are working too much, we also deserve a better life"

So we understood this;  
"Doctors deserve time. Patients deserve presence"

Thus, we are building;  
MRIA (Medical Retrieval Intelligent Assistant)  
An AI-powered healthcare companion that transforms the way healthcare professionals work.

The Problem and Need;

1) Healthcare professionals face excessive workloads, heavy documentation, reduced doctor–patient interaction, and scattered records. Corporate pressure forces doctors to spend more time on screens and paperwork than with patients
2) They have larger problems to focus on, such as saving lives, they spend more time creating reports and looking computers, so that they will not face any legal problems in future.

The Solution : MRIA 

1) It’s an Edge AI device, wearable on a doctor’s collar, that listens to doctor–patient conversations and automatically handles documentation, early diagnosis, and report generation. Instead of typing or writing, everything is done through voice.
2) Nurses and healthcare professionals can also access patient data instantly through MRIA, getting clarity on dosages, case histories, and doctor’s advice, all by just asking it.
3) Doctors gain a true personal companion that takes care of repetitive, non-cognitive tasks so they can focus on what matters most: diagnosis, surgeries, and meaningful patient care.

MRIA is not just a tool, but a true healthcare AI companion 

Working alongside doctors and nurses, reducing their workload, ensuring secure data handling, and bringing back the human connection in healthcare.
